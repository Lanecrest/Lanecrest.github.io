### Hello! 👋

My username is Doctor Worm 🧑‍⚕️🪱 but my real name is Harrison. Lanecrest Tech is the organization name for software that I publish on my own. I've been in the IT support industry for over 15 years.

I like to dabble in coding and have done so on and off for 25 years starting with my TI-83+ calculator where I wrote simple programs in TI-BASIC. I've also built content management systems for my own use using PHP and MySQL and more recently worked with Python to make small apps and games. I am now diving into C# to make some more advanced programs 🧑‍💻

My other interests include history, comedy, linguistics, geography, astronomy, professional wrestling, and board games. If you know what my username is from, you'll also learn what kind of music I like 😄. My organization name is an abstract reference to something as well and there is a clue somewhere on this page if you can figure it out 😏

Stinky Games is the organization name a friend and I use when working on games together and the name comes from my faithful companion, my best bud, and my number one fan, my cat Stinky 😺 (as a cat owner I am legally obligated to talk about my cat).

This website not only aims to showcase the projects I am working on, but also to serve as a repository for my musings, so feel free to check out any of my writings and thanks for dropping by, neighborino! ✌️
