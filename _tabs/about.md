Hello! 👋

My handle is Doctor Worm 🧑‍⚕️🪱 but my name is Harrison. I've been in the IT support 🧑‍💻 industry for over 15 years. I like to dabble in coding as a hobby and have done so on and off for 25 years starting with my TI-83+ calculator where I wrote simple programs in TI-BASIC.

I've also built custom content management systems for my own use using PHP and MySQL and more recently worked with Python to make small apps and games. I am now diving into C# to make mods for one of my favorite games of all time, RimWorld.

My other interests include history, comedy, astronomy, professional wrestling, and board games. If you know what my handle is from, you'll also learn what kind of music I like 😄

This website not only aims to showcase the projects I am working on, but also to serve as a repository for my musings, so feel free to check out any of my writings and thanks for dropping by! ✌️
